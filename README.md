# Stegnography
**Steganography** is the practice of hiding secret data within an ordinary file, such as an image, audio, or video, to conceal its existence. **Image steganography** embeds hidden messages within image pixels using techniques like **LSB (Least Significant Bit) substitution**, where pixel values are slightly altered, making changes imperceptible.
